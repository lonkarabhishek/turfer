- **Display**: Shows color-coded availability hints (ðŸŸ¢ High, ðŸŸ  Medium, ðŸ”´ Low)

#### B. WhatsApp Integration
- **Primary Action**: "Chat to Book" button on every turf card
- **Fallback**: WhatsAppFallback modal for browsers where WhatsApp doesn't auto-open
- **Message**: Auto-generates booking inquiry message with turf details

#### C. Manual Booking Upload
- **Location**: `/src/components/ManualBookingUpload.tsx`
- **Purpose**: Users can manually add bookings they made outside the app

- **Storage**: Actual turf name stored in notes field with `[MANUAL]` prefix
